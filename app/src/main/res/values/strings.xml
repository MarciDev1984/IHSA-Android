        <b>ABOUT IHSA COMPETITION</b>\n
        \n
\t IHSA welcomes beginners through advanced riders in the hunter and Western disciplines to compete individually or on a team. Men and women compete with and against each other.

IHSA eliminates the expenses of horse ownership. Horses are furnished by host colleges and are chosen by drawing lots. The use of personal tack is not allowed and schooling is not permitted. The format fairly tests the horsemanship of the athletes.Divisions range from Beginner to the Open Division for the more experienced riders.Full-time undergraduate students of member colleges or alumni who competed in the IHSA as undergraduates are eligible to compete. Riders qualify for the National Championship Horse Show (Nationals) through a point system. During the year, contestants accumulate points at their IHSA local shows to qualify for the Regional Finals in their respective divisions. The top two riders in each class of the Regional Finals move forward to the Zone Finals. The top two competitors in each class at Zones qualify for Nationals.Each regionâ€™s high-point team competes head to head with the other high point teams in its Zone for the right to represent the Zone for National champion team honors of winning the Collegiate Cup in the hunter seat division and the American Quarter Horse Association (AQHA) Trophy in the Western division.Regional high point riders are eligible for the National Individual Championship. The US Equestrian/Cacchione Cup is awarded to the National Individual hunter seat high-point rider. The AQHA Cup winner receives a saddle and a scholarship. The National Reining Horse Association (NRHA) awards a Morrison Bronze trophy to the Individual Open Reining Horsemanship class winner.Many IHSA competitors have gone on to play significant roles in the equestrian industry and in business.
